# Miscellaneous

- Feedback during drills: Sure you can give instant feedback if something is systematically wrong, but in general, let them have a few goes before giving feedback, then let them try the change a few times
- Give ownership and responsibilities to the players: everything from kit and warm-up to roles in matches
- Skills should be symmetric if they come from a symmetric part of the game
- Starting with simple skill drills with specific numeric targets (e.g. 5 this side/5 that side) can clear the athletes' heads of the "off court stuff"
- Good officials anticipate the play but not the call. _Psychology of Officiating, Weinberg & Richardson_
