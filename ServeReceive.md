# Serve Receive

Read, Decide, Execute

### General Points

- The purpose is to orchestrate an attack
  - make the players discover this for themselves
  - this dictates everything:
    - The passers should always be a __unit__ even if that drags multiple attackers away from the net; a passer should never pass on their own and a server should never beat the unit.  Every drill, are all of the passers reacting to the serve.
  - Consider S/R drills that lead into an attack (teach in context), but keep the focus on the main purpose of the drill
- The key to receive is a passing unit.  The key to a passing unit is communication (physical and verbal).  At no point have I required a "good pass"; good passing is not enough.
- Communication is needed before and during the receive
- Decision-making is as important as contact
- The ball doesn't know technique, it only knows the contact point
- players should be able to use either side of their body to control the contact point and play the ball to their target
- don't give up on a ball: if you think it's out you can track it to the line and decide at the last second
- when the drill makes them move, make sure that movement ends with them in the right posture; they should move, then stop, then play
- Use the lines: have passers leave the line and compress the centre so that the server has to _not_ make a mistake to hit their target.
- "No need to be dramatic on contact"
- S/R drills can "lose energy", but you need the players to drive the energy back up

### Technique

- Start in a neutral body position; you're probably going to have to move to play the ball anyway
- Face the server and angle your passing platform to the target
- The contact should be undramatic: minimise the amount of arm movement/swing and keep the head steady through the contact
