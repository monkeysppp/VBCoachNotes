# Matchplay

## Random notes

- Don't be afraid to "shuffle the pack" if you can't see what's wrong or can't identify a single individual problem as the cause
- If they don't move in a match it's because you didn't teach them they had to move in training
- Success can be limited by errors.  Errors can be classified in 3 ways:
  1. Skill mistakes, where a player fails to execute a skill correctly.  Players must not be blamed for these; nobody intends to make a skill mistake.  These can be fixed by drills in training.
  2. Decision mistakes, where a player makes the wrong choice.  These can be fixed by educating.
  3. Tactical mistakes, where the coach has set the team up incorrectly.  These can be fixed by timeouts, substitutions.
- Match stats should measure both teams and measure the player relating to the stat
- Match stats should be contextual; consider a player's time on court when assessing their kills, consider that setter's don't typically score many points
- Do you know your strongest/weakest rotations?  Do you know the opposition's weakest/strongest rotations?
