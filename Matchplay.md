# Matchplay

## Random notes

- Don't be afraid to "shuffle the pack" if you can't see what's wrong or can't identify a single individual problem as the cause
- If they don't move in a match it's because you didn't teach them they had to move in training
- Success can be limited by errors.  Errors can be classified in 3 ways:
  1. Skill mistakes, where a player fails to execute a skill correctly.  Players must not be blamed for these; nobody intends to make a skill mistake.  These can be fixed by drills in training.
  2. Decision mistakes, where a player makes the wrong choice.  These can be fixed by educating.
  3. Tactical mistakes, where the coach has set the team up incorrectly.  These can be fixed by timeouts, substitutions.
- Match stats should measure both teams and measure the player relating to the stat
- Match stats should be contextual; consider a player's time on court when assessing their kills, consider that setter's don't typically score many points
- Do you know your strongest/weakest rotations?  Do you know the opposition's weakest/strongest rotations?
- Never play a libero unless you have a reason to play a libero
- Never do something in a match that you haven't done in training
- You must have a clear and practiced plan for what to do when the setter takes the first ball

## Tactics

- Target their setter; it massively reduces the accuracy and effectiveness of their set and attack
- When the setter is back court or travelling a long distance, targeting 1 with serve can put time and skill pressure in the setter
- Targeting a setter's running line with serve can be very effective
- Serve to attack structures, communication lanes and setter's running lanes
