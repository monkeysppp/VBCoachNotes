<ul style="margin-left: 300px">
  <li>The pair have a ball that one of the pair is holding</li>
  <li>F feeds a ball and the pair have 3 touches to build an attack</li>
  <li>The players have to throw the "holding" ball between them before they can play the ball in flight</li>
</ul>

1. Both F feed a ball to their passers; the pair pass the 1st ball, then swap sides
2. Both F feed another ball to their passers; the pair pass the 2nd ball, then run toward F
3. F feed the next players running in, then run away to the back of the queues. The previous P take their place in time to get the first pass from the new pair

This can take a while to understand the sequencing; when they do, turn the feed into a volley to make the play continuous.  If that's easy, turn the volley into a roll hit.

<ul style="margin-left: 300px">
  <li>Use a small part of the court and play 3v3</li>
  <li>Each player has a "mirror" on the other team</li>
  <li>When a player attacks, their mirror has to pass.  The ball may bounce once before that pass</li>
</ul>

Adaptations can be adding targets for the hitters, or adding blockers

The ball stays in flight throughout the drill with 3 setters working (note that the S<sub>#</sub> markers on the diagram are positions, not players). One of the setters stays at S<sub>4</sub> and the other two setters work around the positions S<sub>1</sub> to S<sub>3</sub>.

<ul style="margin-left: 300px">
  <li>S<sub>1</sub> starts by feeding to S<sub>2</sub>, then runs to S<sub>3</sub></li>
  <li>S<sub>2</sub> back-sets to S<sub>3</sub>, then runs to S<sub>1</sub></li>
  <li>S<sub>3</sub> sets to S<sub>4</sub>, then runs to S<sub>2</sub></li>
  <li>S<sub>4</sub> plays to S<sub>1</sub></li>
</ul>

<br clear="left"/>

Adaptations can include S<sub>3</sub> running in to cover a tip/attack from S<sub>4</sub> (with S<sub>4</sub> then playing to S<sub>1</sub>) before running back to become S<sub>2</sub>
