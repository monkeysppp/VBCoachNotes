  <li>The hitter rolls a shot across court</li>
  <li>The passers replace the hitters</li>
  <li>Check that the players adapt to the ball they are playing: this is out of system, so the players should maximize chance of success and putting pressure on the opposition, not the high risk balls</li>
</ul>

<ul style="margin-left: 300px">
  <li>Place four cones in a cross, with a passer in the middle</li>
  <li>The passer has to move to each cone and back to the centre in turn, staying low at all times</li>
  <li>When the passer returns to the middle a feeder feeds them a ball to pass</li>
  <li>Are they balanced in all four directions</li>
</ul>

Adaptations can involve having the cones in a diagonal cross

_Bertrand Olie - Volleyball England article [https://www.volleyballengland.org/news/article/5503/the-coaching-corner](https://www.volleyballengland.org/news/article/5503/the-coaching-corner)_

`pressue`

<ul>
  <li>Play a simple match of 3v3 or 4v4</li>
  <li>1 player gets +5 points for a point/kill: do they think about how to maximise points, both as a team and as the golden player?</li>
  <li>Next, the "golden player" gets +5 for a kill and -3 for an error: do they adjust the risk of their attack?</li>
</ul>

### Hitter-Resilience

`pressure, handling failure`

<img alt="A hitter has to get " width="300" src="./images/Hitter-Resilience.png" align="left" style="border: solid 1px #eeeeee; margin: 0px 30px 0px 0px;" />

<ul style="margin-left: 300px">
  <li>Feed an easy ball into the passers, who pass to a setter, who sets to the 4 hitter</li>
  <li>The 4 hitter has to hit 5 clean hits in a row.  The ball has to clear the net and be in.  If they don't get 5 clean hits then their count resets to zero and they start again</li>
  <li>The focus is on how the hitter, and the team, handles failure: do they fold inwards, do they get on with it, do they over-compensate...</li>
</ul>

  <li>The long-feeder feeds a flat ball at the passer, and the passer passes back</li>
  <li>The tip-feeder feeds a tip ball and the passer has to rush in and pass</li>
  <li>The tip ball should force the passer to dive</li>
</ul>

`passing energy`

<img alt="A simple chain of passing three types of ball" width="300" src="./images/Passing-Energy.png" align="left" style="border: solid 1px #eeeeee; margin: 0px 30px 0px 0px;" />

<ul style="margin-left: 300px">
  <li>The passers face a simple chain of 3 kinds of pass:
    <ul style="margin-bottom: 0px;">
      <li>Attack ball: stay low and wide, and intercept the ball in front</li>
      <li>Tip ball: get low and under the ball and use your legs to lift it high for the setter</li>
      <li>Roll-chase: get behind the ball and pull back to the target</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>See if they can play all three energies of ball and whether they adapt their technique as needed</li>
</ul>
