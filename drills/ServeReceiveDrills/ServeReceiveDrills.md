# Serve Receive Drills

Things to remember for every drill:

1. Defence is a team sport; we pass as a unit, we don't abandon a passer.
2. Ultimately, the ball only knows the contact angle in the 0.05s of contact (_The ball knows angles - Carl McGown https://www.teamusa.org/USA-Volleyball/Features/2011/March/02/STOP-Teaching-Passing_)

### Who am I?

<ul style="margin-left: 300px">
  <li>Split into groups.  Give the servers each a characteristic ("serve long", "5-to-5")</li>
  <li>Passers face a number of serves from each server in turn and they have to guess the characteristics, then react to it by implementing a plan to counter it.</li>
</ul>

### Chaos

`receive, pressue, stats`

<img alt="Passing unit continuously face serve while the other side are running as well" width="300" src="./images/Chaos.png" align="left" style="border: solid 1px #eeeeee; margin: 0px 30px 0px 0px;" />

<ul style="margin-left: 300px">
  <li>Both sides run at once (multiple balls may be in flight)</li>
  <li>The servers serve continuously at the receivers (if the passers are ready, the next person serves)</li>
  <li>The receivers pass to the setter, who must set to a target at 4</li>
</ul>

Adaptations can be that the coach or the setter rates the pass in terms of how many hitting options are open to them

### Junk Ball

`rally, switching`

<img alt="Face a serve receive and then a junk ball" width="300" src="./images/Junk-Ball.png" align="left" style="border: solid 1px #eeeeee; margin: 0px 30px 0px 0px;" />

<ul style="margin-left: 300px">
  <li>The receiving team start in a standard rotation</li>
  <li>The server serves a ball over and the receivers build an attack</li>
  <li>The server then comes on court.  Once the first ball is dead, the feeder feeds a junk ball to the server, who plays a free ball over the net</li>
  <li>The working team should have switched by now and build an attack from the free ball.  This attack should be aggressive.</li>
</ul>

### Panic Button

`allways ready`

<img alt="At a moment's notice, a team set up receive and build an attack" width="300" src="./images/Panic-Button.png" align="left" style="border: solid 1px #eeeeee; margin: 0px 30px 0px 0px;" />

<ul style="margin-left: 300px">
  <li>At any point during a training session, the coach can hit the panic button along with calling out a rotation.  The working team must set up their receive in that rotation</li>
  <li>Everyone else goes to the serving line and serve in turn.</li>
  <li>The working team have to play out the rally of each serve.</li>
</ul>

<ul style="margin-left: 300px">
  <li>Both sides run at once (multiple balls may be in flight)</li>
  <li>The server serves (if the serve goes wrong they must stay and join the back of the serving queue), and then runs round to join the queue on the other side of the net</li>
  <li>The passers pass, the target collects the ball.</li>
  <li>The passers move on one position, the left passer becomes the target and the target runs round to the back of the server queue</li>
</ul>

<ul style="margin-left: 300px">
  <li>The server serves at three passers, who pass to a target at 2</li>
  <li>The target is sat on a chair (eating chocolate)</li>
  <li>If the target can catch the ball then the passer replaces them, they become a server and the server replaces the passer</li>
</ul>

</ul>
