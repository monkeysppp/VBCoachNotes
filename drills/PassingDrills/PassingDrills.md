# Passing Drills

### Middle-Pass-4

`movement`, `position`, `high-energy pass`

<img alt="passer moves from 6 to 1 to pass attack ball" width="300" src="./images/Middle-Pass-4.png" align="left" style="border: solid 1px #eeeeee; margin: 0px 30px 0px 0px;" />

<ul style="margin-left: 300px">
  <li>Player starts at 6</li>
  <li>Feeder slaps ball`, `player moves to 1</li>
  <li>Feeder feeds an attack ball and the passer passes to the target</li>
</ul>

<br clear="left"/>

Adaptations can run any hit at any target with movement from any starting position

  <li>The feeder hits a series of hard balls at the passer</li>
  <li>The passer has to get the ball in the air</li>
  <li>Focus in intercepting the path of the ball in front of the player and presenting a stable platform</li>
  <li>The other players clear the balls and shout support</li>
</ul>

### Through-4

`position`

<img alt="Simulate an attach through 4 for a full 6" width="300" src="./images/Through-4.png" align="left" style="border: solid 1px #eeeeee; margin: 0px 30px 0px 0px;" />

<ul style="margin-left: 300px">
  <li>The feeder is on a bench simulating an attach through 4, with 6 players in base position</li>
  <li>The feeder slaps the ball to trigger movement, and the 6 must move to their defensive positions</li>
  <li>The feeder plays an attack ball and the defenders have to play the ball to the setter (if the setter takes the first ball, they play to whoever the backup setter is)</li>
  <li>The drill then <i>stops</i>; you can run it both sides of the net simultaneously</li>
</ul>

<br clear="left"/>

Adaptations can run through different attack lanes and teach different defensive positions

---

### Line-Defence

`position`, `high-energy pass`

<img alt="Back court defense work from 4 hit" width="300" src="./images/Line-Defence.png" align="left" style="border: solid 1px #eeeeee; margin: 0px 30px 0px 0px;" />

### Double-Dutch

_Taught by Dan Hunter (Team GB libero at London 2012) as used by the men's GB team, who's coach was Dutch (hence the name)_

`reactions`

<img alt="play, turn, play" width="300" src="./images/Double-Dutch.png" align="left" style="border: solid 1px #eeeeee; margin: 0px 30px 0px 0px;" />

<ul style="margin-left: 300px">
  <li>Start with each feeder having a ball and the player in the middle, facing away from one of the feeders</li>
  <li>The feeder calls the players name, they turn and immediately get an attack ball</li>
  <li>As soon as they have played the ball, they must turn and face another attack ball from the second feeder
    <ul style="margin-bottom: 0px; list-style-type: circle;">
      <li>The drill then <i>stops</i> and resets.  Some players get stuck in a slow loop of continual turn-pass-turn-pass...  That is not the drill; it should be 2 consecutive, high-speed attack balls with minimal time to react, then we stop and reset.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<br clear="left"/>

Adaptations can be to hit the attack feed earlier and earlier (they should at least feed themselves before they call the passer's name), and to through in the occasional tip ball.
