      <li>Caution that loose balls are clear of the blocker</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

### Middle Man 4

`movement, position`

<img alt="Swing blocking a feed at 4" width="300" src="./images/Middle-Man-4.png" align="left" style="border: solid 1px #eeeeee; margin: 0px 30px 0px 0px;" />

<ul style="margin-left: 300px">
  <li>The blocker starts at 3</li>
  <li>A feeder slaps the ball and the blocker swing blocks out to block a 4-hit</li>
  <li>The feeder feeds a flat ball and the blocker blocks
    <ul>
      <li>Note that a low net helps with feed variability as a feeder off the net tends to go high to avoid the block; the player still has to jump high to reach the ball even if the net is low</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

  <li>Feed a ball into the passers, who pass to the setter</li>
  <li>The setter sets to the 4 hitter, who hits into a 2-person block
    <ul>
      <li>If the block is too weak, replace with a board</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The passers and hitter have to recycle the ball to the setter, who sets to the 4 hitter again</li>
  <li>The team continue to recycle off the block until the ball is dead, then they start again off a feed to the passers</li>
</ul>
