The ball stays in flight throughout the drill with 3 setters working

- S1 starts by feeding to S2, then runs to S3
- S2 back-sets to S3, then runs to S1
- S3 sets to S4, then runs to S2
- S4 plays to S1

Adaptations can include S3 running in to cover tip/attack from S4 (with S4 then playing to S1)

- Setter has 3 front hitting lanes available
- F feeds and calls which lane to set to
- S sets that lane, the hitter hits and collects their ball
- F replaces that hitter

Adaptations can be adding targets for the hitters, or adding blockers
