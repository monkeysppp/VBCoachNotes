# Hitting

## Random notes
- You'd be amazed how many players have somehow learned the approach with the wrong (mirrored) footwork.  Critical to hitting is the last two steps, with the left foot in front (for right-handed players) so the hips and shoulders are open to the setter and the ball coming in.
- When teaching hitting, you can cover some of the technique in isolation (footwork order and rhythm, arm position and swing), but remember that learning should be game-like: get them trying the hit in totality, from preparation to landing, as early as possible.
- If you're looking for power:
  - Throw the hip forwards and use the core muscles to generate more power
