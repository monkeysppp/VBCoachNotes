# Attacking

## Random notes

- Consider what your players can do: Ability => System and Tactics => Execution
- Hitting is a skill; attacking is more, there is a plan
- At the point of taking off, the attacker must have at least three options: hit, tip, roll.  The attacker should be able to decide after taking off
- Attacking must use the full width of the net and put the opposition's middle blocker under pressure
- Attackers should make decisions based on the block
- The only difference between men's and ladies is the number of slide attacks, otherwise training is the same
- Make a conscious decision about the speed of attack, as dictated by the team's ability (to pass and set)
- A faster attack can create holes in the block and rush the opposition's passers; a higher attack can still work well though
  - Consider having a target for the fast attack to hit
  - The setter's aim is to make a 1-on-1 for their hitter
- Train the timing of the attack as a discrete target; teach this by focussing on the approach step the attacker's are on at the point the ball is set

A good attacker should be strong in all stages of the attack:

| Prepare | Load | Engage | Select |
| ------- | ---- | ------ | ------ |
| From scouting the opposition up to the ball being in our setter's hands | Move and approach your contact zone | The jump phase | Know the attacking options available |
