## Random notes

- The best coaches adapt their style to the situation
- Some coaches say "I don't coach the sport, I coach the people", others say "I don't coach the players, I coach the team"

### Attribution

These notes have come from my learning from several sources including, but not limited to, my coaches as a junior (Ken Edwards, Gordon Day, Paul Bohannan), my coaches as an adult (Andy Mant, Emma Thompson, Luke Wiltshire), my tutor (Paul Westhead) my contemporaries (Dave Carr, Saffi Mant, Dave Gunter, Tim Nash) and many online videos and articles.
