# Training

## Random notes

- Focus the drill on the task
- Start slow, lots of repetitions and then speed up
- Visualize in detail as much as you physically practice
- "Pretty training" means you aren't learning anything
- Contextual interference triggers long-term learning
- Coaches should coach: make the players feed and run the drills
- _Stop_ feeding a "free ball": use a "junk ball" where you throw a ball to a player and they have one shot to get the ball into play.  Their shot is then the reall free ball, and the opposition players get to read a read shot (rather than learning the useless skill of how their coach feeds)
- Even at international level, rallies are out-of-system at least 50% of the time, so your training should practice this
- Players looking at the coach is a sign that they're used to being told off, or don't think they have authority to take control
- Coaches get better results by giving solutions to problems or targets the players can attain
- Have a clear and obvious target that's highly visible to the players.  Write it on the wall where you train if necessary

## Reading the Game

"Reading" is one of the most important skills.  If a player can't read the game then they won't play, they will only panic and react.

## Motor Learning

Motor learning is the science of how we acquire skill and maximise skill-transfer through practice.  That is, learning skills that are still evident a week later.  

### Random v Blocked Training:

- Random Training: Different movements and skills in mixed orders
- Blocked Training: Repetitive skill drills

Several studies show that random training leads to more learning and skill-retention.  It forced the player out of auto-pilot, ensuring that they "read, plan, do" for every action in a drill.  It's "uglier" as the contextual interference is higher to start with, but in the long term it produces better players

### Game-like Environment

Make training as "real" as possible; the game teaches the game.

- Is the net the right height
- Have antennae
- An attack should have a block
- Where possible, there should be a score

Ask yourself, "does this look like volleyball?"  Where does the ball come from?  Where does the ball go?  What are the players watching and where are they moving?  What decisions do they make?
