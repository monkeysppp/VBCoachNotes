# Psychology

Rule 1: You cannot improve unless you are willing to change.  Growth takes place outside of your comfort zone.

## Random notes

- Combat against learned helplessness, both in the players in in the coaching staff
- If you treat a low-skill player like a low-skill player then they will believe it too.  Be wary of letting your expectations affect your style
- Be conscious of treating different players differently
- Keep moving forwards.  Win or loose, you have to keep moving forwards
- Coach to who the players are going to be, not who they already are

## Psychology of Learning

- Whole skill training exploits two modes of skill acquisition:
  - Explicit: driven by attaining the goal, a conscious guiding force
  - Implicit: concerned with the dynamics of force-generation, a subconscious activity developed by experience and practice

| Explicit | Implicit |
| --- | --- |
| Tends to dominate in the early phases of learning | Characterises the automated movement of the expert player |
| Tends to stabilize rapidly (quick to learn what to do) | Can be gradual and erratic (slow to learn what to do) |

Optimal training requires:

- Biomechanically correct examples (set the target)
- Clear functional goals
- A wide range of movements/triggers/plays with the same fixed goals
- Early implementation of variable practice and whole-skill training

Don't think in terms of player skill or experience; think in terms of the amount of regulatory stimuli.

## Hierarchy of Competence

- Unconscious Competence | Right Intuition <== hey, this looks like you've trained your system-1 brain to do the right thing.
- Conscious Competence | Right Analysis
- Conscious Incompetence | Wrong Analysis
- Unconscious Incompetence | Wrong Intuition

## Cognitive Influences

_A lot of this comes from various episodes of https://youarenotsosmart.com/podcast/_

- Learned Helplessness  
  _"Failure risks teaching that something is impossible"_  
  If players don't succeed at a task then they risk learning that they can't do something.   That can lead to them thinking they can't do anything, then lead to them thinking there is no point in trying.
- Pluralistic Ignorance  
  _"Nobody believes, but they think everyone else does, so they go along with it"_  
  For example, when the coach asks "is that clear?", nobody asks questions because they think they're the only one that doesn't understand.
- Elaboration Likelihood Model  
  _"If they engage and elaborate on the ideas in a lesson they're more likely to learn it"_  
  - Central route: the recipient gives careful/thorough consideration, leading to elaboration of the ideas and then long=term and predictive learning.  For example, asking players what they're trying to achieve and why in a particular situation, _and_ whether there are other ways to solve the problem
  - Peripheral route: persuasion results from associated +ve/-ve cues in the stimulus even if unrelated to the logic of the stimulus (the credibility/attractiveness of the source or the quality of delivery of the message can have as much influence as the message itself).  For example, an idea from an experienced coach can be taken on board more enthusiastically, even if it's wrong.

## Psychology of Play

- Rules: What are you allowed to do
- Responsibilities: What you are expected to do
- The aim of every shot is to make the ball better than it was before you played it
- Service
  - A closed skill, and the first attacking shot
  - Progression of skill should be: consistency, accuracy, power, movement
  - Serving targets:
    - Bad passers
    - Someone new to the match
    - Someone who just made a mistake
    - Someone who just showed anger or emotion
    - Someone you don't want to be the attacker
- Switching allows specialisation and discrete responsibility
- Communication should be loud, clear, concise and prompt
- Mistakes are made as a team
- If someone calls "out" and the ball is played anyway, what should you do?  Stop and discuss the call?  A call isn't reality, unless the event has happened.
- Get the players to teach themselves.  Don't let them depend on the coach; try to be like a parent and let hem fly on their own.
- For peak performance, each player wants something different; some what time to practice, some what tea and a chat, some want shouting at
- Find the right time and environment to talk; don't attack your stars in front of everyone unless you're doing it for a reason (_https://wisden.com/stories/international-cricket/when-murali-gave-paul-farbrace-the-biggest-spray_)
- Defence is an attitude
- Defence is a team sport
- Process over product: focus on doing the job, not winning
- Ubuntu: You are nothing but what your team makes you; your team mates are nothing but what you make them
- "Wanting to win" and "working really hard" are not enough: everyone wants to win and works really hard.  You have to do your job every single time, every single rally.  That's the definition of discipline.

## Mental Strengths

A player's mental strength is made up of many attributes:

- Awareness: of their attitude and its effect on the game
- Motivation: being committed to hard work towards their goals
- Competitiveness: Enjoys competition and winning; always aware of the score and big points
- Sport Intelligence: insightful of what is happening on court
- Decision making: understand the moment and make the right choice
- Focus: Able to switch on and block out distraction s on demand
- Confidence: Trust in their own ability and play without fear, independent of the risk
- Mental toughness: Perform under pressure, with an optimistic outlook regardless of the result
- Resilience: Bounces back from failure with improved motivation
- Team oriented: Committed to the team's goals and understand their role in it
- Independence: Enjoys taking decisions into their own hands

## Mental Strength Drills

- Competitive:
  - Play a set from 18-18.  The side that wins starts the nest set 16-18 down, so have to work harder to keep winning
- Resilience:
  - A hitter must hit 5 clean hits in a row, a fault resets the count.  How do they handle failure?
- Focus:
  - Asking questions (like the score or the current tactics) during a matchplay drill
- Confidence:
  - Play a match where one player scores 5 points if they kill the ball, so they have confidence of reward for success.  Limit the time they are the special player, so they learn that they are special during specific phases of a match
  - Improve low confidence by working on core skills and a clear definition of the player's role and goals in the team
- General:
  - 5-3: Play a match, but the receiveing team must score 5 points before the serving team score 1
  - 5-3+: Play a match as in 5-3, but when the receiving team score 5, they _must_ win the next point or the serving team win
