# Psychology

Rule 1: You cannot improve unless you are willing to change.  Growth takes place outside of your comfort zone.

## Principles

- Mistakes are made as a team
- If someone calls "out" and the ball is played anyway, what should you do?  Stop and discuss the call?  A call isn't reality, unless the event has happened.
- Get the players to teach themselves.  Don't let them depend on the coach; try to be like a parent and let hem fly on their own.
- For peak performance, each player wants something different; some what time to practice, some what tea and a chat, some want shouting at
- Find the right time and environment to talk; don't attack your stars in front of everyone unless you're doing it for a reason (_https://wisden.com/stories/international-cricket/when-murali-gave-paul-farbrace-the-biggest-spray_)
- Defence is an attitude
- Defence is a team sport
- Process over product: focus on doing the job, not winning
- Ubuntu: You are nothing but what your team makes you; your team mates are nothing but what you make them
- "Wanting to win" and "working really hard" are not enough: everyone wants to win and works really hard.  You have to do your job every single time, every single rally.  That's the definition of discipline.

## Random notes

- Combat against learned helplessness, both in the players in in the coaching staff
- If you treat a low-skill player like a low-skill player then they will believe it too.  Be wary of letting your expectations affect your style
- Be conscious of treating different players differently
- Keep moving forwards.  Win or loose, you have to keep moving forwards
- Coach to who the players are going to be, not who they already are

## Psychology of Learning

- Whole skill training exploits two modes of skill acquisition:
  - Explicit: driven by attaining the goal, a conscious guiding force
  - Implicit: concerned with the dynamics of force-generation, a subconscious activity developed by experience and practice

| Explicit | Implicit |
| --- | --- |
| Tends to dominate in the early phases of learning | Characterises the automated movement of the expert player |
| Tends to stabilize rapidly (quick to learn what to do) | Can be gradual and erratic (slow to learn what to do) |

Optimal training requires:

- Biomechanically correct examples (set the target)
- Clear functional goals
- A wide range of movements/triggers/plays with the same fixed goals
- Early implementation of variable practice and whole-skill training

Don't think in terms of player skill or experience; think in terms of the amount of regulatory stimuli.

## Hierarchy of Competence

- Unconscious Competence | Right Intuition <== hey, this looks like you've trained your system-1 brain to do the right thing.
- Conscious Competence | Right Analysis
- Conscious Incompetence | Wrong Analysis
- Unconscious Incompetence | Wrong Intuition

## Cognitive Influences

_A lot of this comes from various episodes of https://youarenotsosmart.com/podcast/_

- Learned Helplessness  
  _"Failure risks teaching that something is impossible"_  
  If players don't succeed at a task then they risk learning that they can't do something.   That can lead to them thinking they can't do anything, then lead to them thinking there is no point in trying.
- Pluralistic Ignorance  
  _"Nobody believes, but they think everyone else does, so they go along with it"_  
  For example, when the coach asks "is that clear?", nobody asks questions because they think they're the only one that doesn't understand.
- Elaboration Likelihood Model  
  _"If they engage and elaborate on the ideas in a lesson they're more likely to learn it"_  
  - Central route: the recipient gives careful/thorough consideration, leading to elaboration of the ideas and then long=term and predictive learning.  For example, asking players what they're trying to achieve and why in a particular situation, _and_ whether there are other ways to solve the problem
  - Peripheral route: persuasion results from associated +ve/-ve cues in the stimulus even if unrelated to the logic of the stimulus (the credibility/attractiveness of the source or the quality of delivery of the message can have as much influence as the message itself).  For example, an idea from an experienced coach can be taken on board more enthusiastically, even if it's wrong.

## Psychology of Play

Some of this comes from _Psychology of Officiating, Weinberg & Richardson_.

### Confidence

Confidence is a psychological skill; it can be learnt:

- Thinking: practice thinking that you can and will succeed at what you set out to do, and train your inner voice to think that way
- Acting: actions can drive your feelings, so act tall and confident in your abilities and certain of your actions
- Visualise: see yourself succeeding at the actions you intend to perform, particularly at things you are still learning
- Experience: the more you do and the more you succeed, the more you know that you can continue to succeed; the more you grow, the more you know that you can continue to grow
- Technique: focussing on specific parts of a technique can help understand them to the point knowing you can do them
- Preparation: being physically fit and mentally ready are not things you can just switch on, you need to build mechanisms of preparation for before you perform

### Motivation

You have to want to do the thing.  Combat a loss of motivation by setting goals:

- Goals should be challenging but realistic
- A goal should be positive; something you will _do_, not something you will _avoid_
- You should have both short term goals (to chart progress by) and long term goals (to set the direction), all with a deadline
- Goals should be written down and seen so that you are reminded of them often
- You should identify strategies to help achieve your goals; don't juts generally wish them to happen

You can also maintain motivation by:

- Finding inspiration from other successful performer (in turn, you may become an inspiration for someone else and not even know it)
- Reward yourself for doing well
- Talk to your contemporaries; they can help when you can feel yourself losing motivation

### Relaxation

Relaxation's enemy is anxiety, which can reduce peak performance.  

Anxiety can come from a number of sources:

- Fear of failure, which we address with:
  - Evaluating all aspects of a performance and not just the mistakes, and attempt impartial evaluation (don't give yourself all of the blame if the team looses)
  - Separating your ego from your performance; a bad game does not make you a bad person
  - Recontextualise failure as a step on learning to succeed
- Fear of inadequacy, which we address with:
  - Planning and preparation before the activity, both long and short term
- Fear of loss of control, which we address with:
  - Identifying and accepting what you can and cannot control

Anxiety manifests itself:

- Physically, as the "fight, flight, freeze" response, with an increase in adrenaline accompanied by an increase in breathing and heart rate.  Without control, excess physical anxiety can cause fatigue through useless muscle contraction.  We address this with:
  - Controlled breathing.  Given that breathing is an autonomic activity that you can consciously control, athletes can focus on their breathing to help control physical anxiety.  Breathe slowly, in through the nose, out through the mouth; focus on how your diaphragm moves and how your shoulders relax.
  - Progressive relaxation.  Focussed tensing and relaxing on different muscle groups can regain control over them.
- Psychologically through reduced concentration and poor decision making.  Athletes need to maintain a high level of emotional engagement but without anxiety.  We address this with:
  - Self-talk, focussing on positive self-talk and dismissing negative self-talk.  Like any other skill, this can be learned by first becoming aware of your self-talk, identifying wither it's usually positive or negative and learning to replace common negative self-talk with a positive equivalent ("I made a mistake" -> "I can relax and focus on my job")
  - If a stimulus (like an aggressive opposition) regularly produces anxiety, then an athlete can learn to recognise and reassess that stimulus ("if that's how they play then they risk loosing _their_ emotional balance; I'm fine in my own zone")
  - If the athlete can spot a negative thought early, they can use a trigger phrase or action to stop that thought and focus on moving on (Joe Root finds smiling works wonders)
  - Slow down!


#### Emotional state

The athlete's emotional state is something they can learn to use, so they can maintain being "in the zone" (athletes should not fear adrenaline - they feel nervous because the game is important to them).

Consider the inverted-U plot of arousal-v-performance.  This is most correlated with positive emotional energy.  Where this inverted-U sits is also unique to each individual athlete.  Athletes first need to be aware of their emotional state, then correlate that state with good performances.  This can be formalised by rating confidence/motivation/relaxation/control/energy/self-talk/concentration/enjoyment for various performances and correlated with how successful those performances were.  They can also be considered at different phases of a performance (like in the deciding set of a match)

### Concentration


## Mental Strengths

A player's mental strength is made up of many attributes:

- Awareness: of their attitude and its effect on the game
- Motivation: being committed to hard work towards their goals
- Competitiveness: Enjoys competition and winning; always aware of the score and big points
- Sport Intelligence: insightful of what is happening on court
- Decision making: understand the moment and make the right choice
- Focus: Able to switch on and block out distraction s on demand
- Confidence: Trust in their own ability and play without fear, independent of the risk
- Mental toughness: Perform under pressure, with an optimistic outlook regardless of the result
- Resilience: Bounces back from failure with improved motivation
- Team oriented: Committed to the team's goals and understand their role in it
- Independence: Enjoys taking decisions into their own hands

## Mental Strength Drills

- Competitive:
  - Play a set from 18-18.  The side that wins starts the nest set 16-18 down, so have to work harder to keep winning
- Resilience:
  - A hitter must hit 5 clean hits in a row, a fault resets the count.  How do they handle failure?
- Focus:
  - Asking questions (like the score or the current tactics) during a matchplay drill
- Confidence:
  - Play a match where one player scores 5 points if they kill the ball, so they have confidence of reward for success.  Limit the time they are the special player, so they learn that they are special during specific phases of a match
  - Improve low confidence by working on core skills and a clear definition of the player's role and goals in the team
- General:
  - 5-3: Play a match, but the receiving team must score 5 points before the serving team score 1
  - 5-3+: Play a match as in 5-3, but when the receiving team score 5, they _must_ win the next point or the serving team win
